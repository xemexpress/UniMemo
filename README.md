# UniMemo

## Vision

Prosper, your way.

## Mission

To uncover the full potential of humankinds.

## Background

UniMemo is a concept of focusing on mankind's happiness in terms of the average amount of time we spent every day on things we like to do.

In today's world, however, resources are rich but can be easily and unnecessarily missed. As a result, much of our time might be exhausted by overcoming information barriers to get those 'missed' resources back. So the solution UniMemo proposed is this: we connect memories among things and people into one united system that can decide, provide and initiate (with your acknowledgement & consent) a series of identified services (under providers' consent) whenever you need.
