**Project Name:** UniMemo

**Problem:**

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Lives seem to be convenient today. In Hong Kong, we have excellent transportation systems which take us to almost all the destinations. We have a dense population which comes along with shops and restaurants everywhere to satisfy our needs. However, the well-developed transportation network and 24-hour restaurants do not fulfil our needs when we are in a rush but forgot to buy something we had promised to bring our friends. They cannot help us if we need to stay at HKBU for the whole day while we want to eat some snacks which can only be bought in Muji at Festival Walk. Moreover, we need to pay for the delivery fee or have minimum purchase when we order takeaways or when we shop online.
</div>

<br/>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
UniMemo aims to be a platform which helps people to solve the above problems. We want to help people to save time, create value and connect the community. We believe what is saved is what is earned.
</div>

<br/>

<div style='margin: 10px 55px 0;'>
<b>Demand:</b> We lack a flexible shopping solution which allows us to receives commodities with the least restrictions.
</div>
<br/>
<div style='margin: 0 55px; text-align: justify;'>
e.g. If we forgot to buy something when we bypass the shop, we need to spend extra time to return to the shop.
</div>
<br/>
<div style='margin: 10px 55px 0; text-align: justify;'>
<b>Supply:</b> People ignored or did not realize they can give others a helping hand without spending extra time.
</div>
<br/>
<div style='margin: 0 55px; text-align: justify;'>
e.g. Help someone to buy a hamburger when they are buying chicken nuggets.
</div>

<br/>

**Solution:**

<div style="text-align: justify;">
UniMemo is a social platform which allows people to help each other shop in passing.
</div>

<br/>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
An offerer is someone who wants to buy something and posts a Memo on UniMemo to see if anyone would like to accept the offer and help him/her buy the things in passing. UniMemo will notify users who are traveling on streets/planning to move from one place to another given their routes will bypass i)the shops where the requested commodities can be bought and ii)where the offeror is located. People who accept the Memo will become an offeree. After settlement, the offeree can get 10% of price of the commodities as commission. By doing this, offerers can save lots of time and break restrictions when they want to shop without going to the shops themselves, while offerees can help others in passing and earn a little profit without spending extra time.
</div>

<br/>

**Business Potential:**

- According to the Census and Statistics Department, the number of Hong Kong citizens aged 15 and above who had used online purchasing service for personal matters is 2.22 million (Jun-Sep 2018).

- Hong Kong has a dense population. Therefore, we have high chance to share same routes with others and bypass each other in daily lives.

# Safety Issues

Safety is our top priority.

1. **Identity and Face Verification**

   <div style="text-align: justify;">After providing email and mobile number for registration, you need to upload a picture of your Permanent ID Card (clearly visible with four corners shown) and a profile photo (clear, whole face with sunglasses and hat off) for further verification.</div>

2. **Emergency Button**

   <div style="text-align: justify;">Quickly call and share your location and Memo interaction details with authorities to get help during the settlement whenever necessary.</div>

3. **Share My Memo Interaction**

   <div style="text-align: justify;">Share your location and Memo interaction status with friends and family.</div>

4. **Two-way Evaluation**

   <div style="text-align: justify;">Memo interactions with low ratings are recorded and followed up, and users may be removed.</div>

<br/><br/>

# Business Model

#### Geo-targeting Advertising

<div style="text-align: justify;">
System will display advertisement of related commodity according to geographic location.
