# About Safety

Safety is our top priority.

1. **Identity and Face Verification**

   After providing email and mobile number for registration, you need to upload a picture of your Permanent ID Card (clearly visible with four corners shown) and a profile photo (clear, whole face with sunglasses and hat off) for further verification.

2. **Emergency Button**

   Quickly call and share your location and Memo interaction details with authorities to get help during the settlement whenever necessary.

3. **Share My Memo Interaction**

   Share your location and Memo interaction status with friends and family.

4. **Two-way Evaluation**

   Memo interactions with low ratings are recorded and followed up, and users may be removed.
