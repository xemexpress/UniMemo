# UniMemo - To uncover the full potential.

## Background

UniMemo is a concept of focusing on mankind's happiness in terms of the average amount of time we spent per day on things we like to do.

In today's world, however, resources are rich but can be easily and unnecessarily missed. So the solution UniMemo proposed is this: we connect memories among things and people into one united system that can provide a series of identified services whenever you need.
