### Details

### <u>Components of a Memo</u>

##### As an offerer, offer 10 % of price of the commodity as commission to let a bypasser shop for you. Steps are as follows:

1. Search keywords of the commodity. 

   ```markdown
   Each item of commodity in the search results contains a product name, a picture and a bar code. You can use them to further confirm which item you want to buy. 
   ```

2. Confirm the items and the number of items you want to buy.

   ```markdown
   The system can gather the price of a commodity sold in different shops (Shopping Points). You can adjust the price according to your budget, region or rating given to those Shopping Points. The more the Shoping Points selling that commodity, the higher the chance the Memo will be read.
   ```

3. Confirm the place and time for settlement. 

4. Pay the deposit.

   ```markdown
   The system will derive the highest selling price of the commodity sold in differnt Shopping Points as the deposit. 10 % of price of the commodity will be added up as the reward given to the bypasser. During settlement, the deposit will be used to pay for the commodity which has been confirmed by the store of Shopping Point and has been accepted by a bypasser. Balance (if there is any) will be returned to the digital wallet owned by the offerer. If you cannot pay the deposit, the Memo will not be posted. 
   ```

5. Post the Memo. If it is accepted by a bypasser, follow the specified place and time to settle the transaction. 

   ```markdown
   If you want to cancel a Memo which has not been accepted by a bypasser, the deposit paid in advance will be fully returned. Otherwise, the price paid in advance for the commodity will be returned to the offerer while the remaining deposit, which is the reward of 10% of the price, will be given to the bypasser as a compensation.
   ```









##### A bypasser will be given 10 % of price of commodity as reward when helping the offerer to purchase in passing. Simple steps are as follows:

1. Input the destination you are heading to.

   ```markdown
   The system will search for the shortest route and provide Starting Points, Destinations and Shopping Points along it. You can choose relevant route according to your own time arrangement.
   ```

2. Choose the route and confirm the commodity which you can help others to buy in passing.

3. Follow the instructions to buy in passing and finish the settlement.



###### Components of Memo in details：

#### Deposit

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Deposit is the amount of money paid by an offerer before sending out the Memo. It is used to pay for the commodity and reward for the bypasser. The bypasser can only secure the deposit after accepting the order to help the offerer to buy the commodity in passing. <u>During settlement, the offerer reserves the right to decide whether to pay for the commodity if it is not in its intact form</u>, e.g. the package is opened or damaged. The bypasser does not need to give the commodity to the offerer if the offerer does not pay.
</div>

#### Shopping List

<div style="text-align: justify;">
A shopping list consists of items of commodity. Items of commodity state clearly the <u>name</u>, <u>picture</u>, <u>barcode</u>, <u>shopping point</u>, <u>price</u> and <u>number of items</u>. Potential bypassers will only receive posts of Memo when <u>their originally planned route and shopping points are approximate</u>.
</div>

<div style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;">
Potential bypassers <u>can choose the type of  commodity and the number of it accroding to their own interest</u>. By confirming the commodity and number of items they are willing to help the offerer to buy, they become a bypasser. Bypassers should <u>show a barcode</u> to the cashier when they pay. The cashier will scan the barcode and <u>check whether the commodity and number of items are correct</u>. After checking, the bypasser can pay and the cashier will put the items into a sealed bag with a receipt to ensure that the commodity will not be swapped. Meanwhile, the system will update the status of transaction, including commodity check, payment and sealing.
</div>

#### Place and Time for Settlement

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Potential bypassers will only receive relevant Memo when <u>the time for settlement matches with the estimated arrival time</u> and <u>the place for settlement is approximate to the orginally planned route</u>.
</div>








### <u>Key Support</u>

#### Online Payment Platform

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Online payment platforms include <u>digital wallets</u> and <u>paying agents</u>. They help transfer money and deal with the paid deposit so that the offerers are reassured to pay in advance and trust is built among users.
</div>



#### Business Partners

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Shopping points (Stores) will do the quotation, promise to arrage refund for unchecked commodity, as well as putting the paid commodity into the sealed bag so as to avoid the commodity being swapped.
</div>

<div style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;">
Once the sealed bag is opened, the commodity is checked. Stores reserve the right not to refund it. Regarding the commodity, the system <u>only recommends those which are sealed or have standardized production, excluding cooked to order takeaways, vegetables, fruits, seafoods, meat, dairy and soy products that require constant low temperature storage</u>.
</div>



#### Anonymous Communication

<div style="text-align: justify;">
To provide users with instant voice, text and image messaging while protecting users' privacy.
</div>



#### Two-way Evaluation

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Users can evaluate the interections they had with others after the settlement. Good ratings are specified by a default sentence while reasons must be given to verify bad ratings.
</div>

| Offerer                            | Bypasser                         |

#### Roadshow Algorithm

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The system will calculate the Shopping Points and Points of Settlement along the route using the Starting Points and Ending Points provided by the users. Users can let the system start roadshow algorithm by two ways:
</div>

| Way                | Default<div>Starting Point</div>                   | Default<div>Destination</div> | Set<div>Notification</div> |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Directional Search | Current location<div>or to enter by yourself</div> | Must enter by yourself        | √                          |
| General Search     | Preset frequent location                           | Preset frequent location      | √                          |




<div style="text-align: justify;">
The system defines 'extra travel distrance no more than 15 minutes' as 'bypassing' with a speed of 1.25 meters per second. Ideal situations will be specially marked:
</div>

| Ideal Situations                                             | Brief Introduction             |

| Shopping Point & Point of Settlement are <u>approximate</u>  | Settle after purchased         |
| Point of Settlement & My Destination are <u>approximate</u>  | Settle when arrived            |
| Shopping Point & Starting Point are <u>approximate</u>       | Start and purchase             |
| Shopping Point & My Destination are <u>the same</u><div>(if consider route of return)</div> | Same Shopping Point            |
| Shopping Point & My Destination are <u>approximate</u><div>(if consider route of return)</div> | Nearby Shopping Points         |
| Point of Settlement & My Starting Point are <u>approximate</u><div>(if consider route of return)</div> | Settle near the Starting Point |

<div style="text-align: right">
